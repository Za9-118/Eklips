# ![Eklips](img/icon.png) Eklips Engine
A 2D Node hierarchy-based game engine written in Python using Pyglet.

# Features
For now, the features are:
 - 16 different Nodes (Window, 2D, GUI, etc..)
 - Resource object support
 - Embedding files into the program support (Use `program:/` instead of `res:/`. But if the app isn't built into a Windows executable yet, `program:/` will act just like `res:/`.)
 - Pre-built Loading
 - Custom filesystem similar to Godot (`res:/`, `program:/`, `user:/`..)
 - Pre-built Saving and Settings support
 - Layering support
 - Event support
 - Pre-built console and command support // WIP
 - Pre-built keybind support
 - Python scripting support
