This is the Sol game engine made by Za in Python.
This project aims for people in PyGame to easily make UI elements and games.

to build the Sol python file into a LIB file (dll, so, etc) first, install Python and Cython, and launch the "build.py", you will get the C version of the source code in the "cxx" folder. and the full library file of Sol in the "build" folder. Make sure to clean the source folder tho, Library files will be copied there for no reason.. I don't know why.
